# [The Delusional Ruler] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Individual]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Krishna Priya B] - [LBS Institute of Technology for Women,Poojapura,TVM ]

### Project Description
[Absolutely Incorrect Ruler is a hilariously useless measuring tool that calculates distances in absurd units like jellybeans, flamingos, and existential dread. With random themes, funny comments, mouse trails, and sound effects.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Tired of boring units like inches or centimeters. This ruler lets you measure things in Flamingos, Jellybeans, or even Existential Dread Units. It's wildly inaccurate, completely useless ‚Äî and 100% necessary.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[This is a absolutely useless measuring tool that gives results in ridiculous units. It doesn‚Äôt aim to be accurate ‚Äî just entertaining. Perfect for wasting time with style.]
